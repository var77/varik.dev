Hi there! I started my tech journey in 2016, building real-time multiplayer games. After that I worked in healthcare projects, creating data pipelines and working with cloud providers like AWS (Certified Developer), GCP, and Linode, then moved to web3 space working with blockchain and Solidity.

Now, I focus on PostgreSQL and AI. For the past 1.5 years, Iâ€™ve been working on [Lantern](https://lantern.dev), writing PostgreSQL extensions in C and Rust, and building the Lantern Cloud Controlplane.

In my free time, I love playing Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges with our team [Ethnical Hackers](https://ctftime.org/team/164682)
