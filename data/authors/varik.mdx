Hi there! I started my tech journey in 2016, building real-time multiplayer games. After that I worked in healthcare projects, creating data pipelines and working with cloud providers like AWS (Certified Developer), GCP, and Linode, then moved to web3 space working with blockchain and Solidity.

I have extensive experience with PostgreSQL and AI. I worked at [Lantern](http://github.com/lanterndata/lantern) for 2 years, where I wrote PostgreSQL extensions in C and Rust and built the Lantern Cloud Controlplane.

In my free time, I love playing Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges with our team [Ethnical Hackers](https://ctftime.org/team/164682)
